This folder contains scripts for cards with confirmed TCG rulings.
Please use this: http://www.yugioh-card.com/en/gameplay/rulings_errata.html
Only cards listed in that website will be scripted. Use the same card numbers.

When a Player chooses TCG banlist, the game will load scripts from a subfolder
called tcg inside scripts folder. The scripts in that folder will take priority.
This way, we can use TCG rulings in our game for TCG players.
